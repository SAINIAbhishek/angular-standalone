  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Directive Composition API</h2>
  <p>The Directive Composition API allows us to compose directives into components and other directives. This API works only with standalone components (and standalone directives). As the 14 version added the standalone property, the 15 version added a hostDirectives property.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">What are "Standalone Components"?</h2>
  <p>
    Standalone components are regular Angular components with one important
    twist: They don't require a <code>@NgModule</code> as a wrapper.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead, you can use them, well, "standalone". They define their own
    dependencies and can be imported and used anywhere.
  </p>
  <p appHighlight>
    It's also not just "standalone components", but also "standalone directives"
    and "standalone pipes".
